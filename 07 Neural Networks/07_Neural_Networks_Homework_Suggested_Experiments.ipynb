        "This class must implement two methods: First, `__init__` for putting the x and y values in two lists (of equal length and in the same order, of course). This method will be called exactly once: when an object of this type is created.\n",
        "The second method, `__getitem__` is a called whenever the object of type `SmsSpanDataset` is asked to return a tuple corresponding to a single x and a single y value.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note: `__getitem__` is a magic method in Python that will be called when we access an object with an index: `train_data[i]` will call this method with `index=i`.\n",

In PyTorch, vectors, matrices, and higher-dimensional tensors are all modelled using the [`torch.tensor`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html) datatype. The `dtype` parameter tells PyTorch what kind of values we want to store in this tensor, here, it's 32-bit floating point values.\n",
