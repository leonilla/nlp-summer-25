    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "First, we will map out SMS Spam dataset to a [torch.util.data.Dataset](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html) object. For doing so, we first need to define a class (here called `SmsSpanDataset`) that is a subclass of `Dataset`.\n",
    "This class must implement two methods: First, `__init__` for putting the x and y values in two lists (of equal length and in the same order, of course). This method will be called exactly once: when an object of this type is created.\n",
    "The second method, `__getitem__` is a called whenever the object of type `SmsSpanDataset` is asked to return a tuple corresponding to a single x and a single y value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: `__getitem__` is a magic method in Python that will be called when we access an object with an index: `train_data[i]` will call this method with `index=i`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important part happens in these lines:\n",
    "```\n",
    "self.X = [torch.tensor(x, dtype=torch.float32) for x in data_set[\"x\"]]\n",
    "self.Y = [torch.tensor(y, dtype=torch.float32) for y in data_set[\"label\"]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, we map each input vector `x` to an input vector object that torch can use on the GPU. In PyTorch, vectors, matrices, and higher-dimensional tensors are all modelled using the [`torch.tensor`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html) datatype. The `dtype` parameter tells PyTorch what kind of values we want to store in this tensor, here, it's 32-bit floating point values.\n",
